The project is an analysis report for hotel data focusing on booking and cancellation patterns. The aim is to provide insights that will assist hotels in effectively managing their business operations.

Key components of the analysis report include:

Data Collection: Gathering hotel booking and cancellation data from various sources, such as booking platforms or hotel management systems.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Performing data cleaning tasks to ensure the data is accurate and reliable. This may involve handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types. Preprocessing steps may include feature engineering to extract relevant information from the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the hotel data to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations. This involves visualizing the data using charts, graphs, and statistical measures to gain insights into booking and cancellation behavior.

Predictive Modeling: Building predictive models to forecast future booking and cancellation rates. This may involve using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, or neural networks to predict hotel occupancy and cancellation probabilities.

Recommendations and Insights: Providing actionable recommendations based on the analysis findings. This may include suggestions for optimizing pricing strategies, improving customer service, or implementing marketing campaigns to reduce cancellations and increase bookings.

Overall, the analysis report serves as a valuable tool for hotels to make data-driven decisions and enhance their business strategies in the competitive hospitality industry.
